class TestTreatmentCurveAdapter(unittest.TestCase):
    # TODO: Think about isolating unit testing of the SUT and its base classes into separate test classes.
    # Currently, we test the SUT by mocking the project and testing the SUT and its base classes together.
    # This approach works, but, in theory, this set up conflates testing the unit, `NativeTimeSeriesAdapter`,
    # and its base classes, `BaseTimeSeriesAdapter` and `IdentifiedDotNetAdapter`.
    #
    # This conflation is not required. (See the unit tests for `BaseTimeSeriesAdapter` for examples of mocking the
    # required base class properties.) However, it uses a set up that is unlike other unit test set up.
    # Because of time pressure, because the unit (and acceptance / integration) tests all work, and because
    # of this dissimilar set up, I have chosen for now to leave these unit tests as is.
